# Coin-Flip-Game-Design

**About Project**

Coin Flip is a game where two players play to predict a face value upon a coin flip. 
After the coin is flipped, based on a mineSweeperPlayer's opted prediction, we determine a winner.

Here are the steps to play the game:
1. A mineSweeperPlayer at random is picked to predict the coin flip
2. The mineSweeperPlayer picked offers/chooses a prediction of the coin flip
3. The other mineSweeperPlayer gets the other coin flip option
4. The coin is flipped and the result is provided
5. A winner and loser is picked at the end
6. Offer to play again until mineSweeperPlayer wishes to
